When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?

Answer: The LOESS produced a better result for me. This is because of the prediction made in Kalman filtering for transition matrices.


In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.]

Speed can be used used to predict the next point in the next second. And timestamp can be used to calculate speed and so on. Different types of data should help get better prediction.
