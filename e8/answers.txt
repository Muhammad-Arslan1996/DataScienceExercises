kNN classifier performs the best with 15 neighbours. My theory is that for similar/same  colour the plots or rgb values are close to each other. So using nearest neighbour is best way to predict. For e.g. majority of the neighbours of colour red would be red or a closer colour. And out RGB LAB and HSV, LAB works best for me. My theory would be similar to what description we were given in exercise 7 "the LAB colour space is much more perceptually uniform"

I think model is making reasonable mistakes here because looking at the data, most predicted values(cities) are geographically closer to predicted values(cities). I make this reasoning also considering the fact that features are average over a month not a single data point. So closer cities can have similar monthly weather features. Other features to make it better would humidity and wind.
